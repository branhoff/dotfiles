## Vision Statement

GitGrub is a social recipe management platform that brings the power of
version control to cooking. By applying software development principles
to recipe creation and sharing, GitGrub enables cooks and enthusiasts to track recipe evolution, collaborate on
improvements, and build upon each other's recipes. GitGrub makes recipe iteration visible, traceable, and social.

## Problem Statement

Current recipe management solutions face several limitations:
- No structured way to track recipe changes over time
- Difficulty collaborating on recipe improvements
- No clear lineage of how recipes evolve and branch into variants
- Limited ability to merge improvements back into original recipes
- Social sharing focuses on final products rather than the creative
  process

## Viewing Mermaid UML Diagrams
We use Mermaid UML for diagramming. It should be visible in GitHub by default. There are a number of add-ons in JetBrains and VS Code that will let you visualize the charts in preview mode.

You can also make use of Mermaid's diagram editing tool: https://mermaid.live/
